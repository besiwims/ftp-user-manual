## Introduction

This manual is to teach or demonstrate how to login into ftp accounts and upload coxylib library files for testing how to mint tokens in Cardano smart contracts,specifically with HELIOS smart contract in coxygen global.

## About FTP

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a network protocol used for the transfer of files from one host to another. FTP is a way to download, upload, and transfer files from one location to another.

## About COXYLIB Library

The COXYLIB library is a simplifier of our Helios classes. With the COXYLIB library, you can integrate Cardano Smart Contract easily and quickly on any website as in this manual. You can use Helios nodes, etc., but you will need to learn more different tools, and it will take a longer period. However, COXYGEN has made it easy and simple. Just use the COXYLIB library from COXYGEN global. It will give you direct functions to code, get the results, and display your result.

## Steps to get into FTP

1.First use (net2ftp.com) server to log into your accounts

2.click on FTP and SSH online,it opens net2ftp login

4.maintain server port 21

5.ftp user name (mary.coxygen.co)

6.enter password

7.verify (am not a robot)
 
8.then login

## Uploading coxylib library file

There are two ways to upload this library, one is to upload the whole coxylib library folder from the coxygen main file, and the second is to open the coxylib library folder from coxygen main and upload each file that you see in the coxylib library.

#### step one(uploading whole folder)

We are using Coxygen,therefore go to github and search for wims/coxygen.co

1.click on coxylib library

2.click on code 

3.click on download zip

4.choose coxylib and extract 

5.go back to net2ftp login(ftp.coxygen.co) and upload

6.now choose coxylib file 

7.click the correct symbol to upload/submit

#### step two(one by one upload)

1. go to net2ftp(ftp.coxygen.co)

2. click on New dir

3. creat new directories with name(js),now click on correct symbol to create

4. click on js directory

5. click on choose file

6. search for file at downloads on your pc,click on coxylib main

7. now open coxylib folder,choose files one by one (jquery js, jimpa js, helios js)

8. click on the correct symbol to upload/submit.

## Other libraries uploads

To complete the process of testing on how to mint tokens in smart contracts, there are other coxylib libraries that needs to be uploaded for a successful and smooth testing.These include, index, mint AssetScript and mint Asset.js. To upload these libraries follow the steps below.

#### steps

1.at net2ftp(ftp.coxygen.co)

2.click on choose file

3.go to downloads on your  pc again

4.click on coxylib main

5.click on index 

6.go back to coxylib and click on mint AssetScript

7.again click mint Asset.js

8.click on correct symbol to upload/submit.

## Running or testing index file steps

1.at net2ftp(ftp.coxygen.co) 

2.click on index

3.edit website to (coxygen.co/coxygen.co/demo/index.hmtl)

4.Nami wallet appears,click on access

5.click on reload buttom to run it.

## Conclusion

These are the simple steps to follow as a new developer to login, upload, and simply test some libraries with coxygen coxylib libraries. Coxygen global is there to make it easiler and simplier for you to learn web development.
